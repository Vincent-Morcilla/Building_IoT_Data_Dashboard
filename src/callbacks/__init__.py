"""
Callbacks module for app interactivity and data-driven updates.

This module manages the callbacks that enable user interactions with 
plots, filters, and other dynamic components in the app.

Modules:
    - download_button_callbacks: Manages callbacks for downloading data in CSV format.
    - general_callbacks: Handles general app interactions such as page routing 
                         and logo navigation.
    - plot_callbacks: Registers plot-specific callbacks, integrating both generalised 
                      and customised functions from the `actions` folder to apply 
                      filters, transformations, and other dynamic updates.
